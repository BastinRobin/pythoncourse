# Python Course

This is a work-in-progress repository intended to:

- Teach Python using public material
- Test learning using a series of exercises / questions
- Evaluate the tests automatically

... thereby creating a set of automatabled self-learning certification programmes to teach Python.

The intent is to re-use as much as possible.
