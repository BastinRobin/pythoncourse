# Python Course

This is a work-in-progress repository intended to:

- Teach Python using public material
- Test learning using a series of exercises / questions
- Evaluate the tests automatically

... thereby creating a set of automatabled self-learning certification programmes to teach Python.

The intent is to re-use as much as possible.

The modules in no particular order are:

- Data types: datetime, time, json, collections, dateutil
- Scraping data: lxml, re, requests, urllib, urlparse
- Working with files: os, sys, glob
- Working with data: pandas and numpy
- Working with databases: pandas, csv, sqlite3, sqlalchemy
- Building a web app: tornado, logging
- Testing: nose
- Statistical analysis: scipy, stats and autolyse from Gramex
- Using colours: colorsys, color from Gramex
- Layout algorithms: layout and treemap, from Gramex
- Parallel processing: subprocess, tornado.concurrent
